# Setup Bats and Bats libraries

This GitHub Action installs [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and the four major bats libraries:

* [bats-support](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support)
* [bats-assert](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-assert)
* [bats-detik](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-detik)
* [bats-file](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-file)

The action can be also instructed to select which libraries to install.
While Linux is fully supported, windows and macos runners should work as well, check the [specific](#windows-and-macos-support) readme part.

## How to use it

``` yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
   my_test:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     name: Install Bats and bats libs
     steps:
       - name: Checkout
         uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Setup Bats and bats libs
         id: setup-bats
         uses: bats-core/bats-action@3.0.0
       - name: My test
         shell: bash
         env:
          BATS_LIB_PATH: ${{ steps.setup-bats.outputs.lib-path }}
          TERM: xterm
         run: bats test/my-test
```

By default the action will pass the `BATS_LIB_PATH` value as output `lib-path`.
You can use it like the below example and load the libraries in your tests with:

```bash
_tests_helper() {
    export BATS_LIB_PATH=${BATS_LIB_PATH:-"/usr/lib"}
    bats_load_library bats-support
    bats_load_library bats-assert
    bats_load_library bats-file
    bats_load_library bats-detik/detik.bash
}
```

## Libraries Path

For each of the Bats libraries, you can choose to install them in the default location (`/usr/lib/bats-<lib-name>` for linux) or specify a custom path.

For example, if you want to install `bats-support` in the `./test/bats-support` directory, you can configure it as follows:


``` yaml
      [...]
       - name: Setup Bats and Bats libs
         id: setup-bats
         uses: bats-core/bats-action@2.0.0
         with:
           support-path: ${{ github.workspace }}/test/bats-support
      [...]
```

## About Caching

The caching mechanism for the `bats binary` is always available. However, the caching for the `bats libraries` is dependent on the location of each library path. If a library is located within the $HOME directory, caching is supported. Conversely, if a library is located outside the $HOME directory (which is the default location per each library), caching is not supported. This is due to a known limitation with sudo and the cache action, as detailed in this GitHub issue: https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/946.

**If you want to cache bats libraries you must install them inside HOME directory**.
For instance this is an example that will use the github workspace handle (works for linux/win/mac):

```yaml
      [...]
       - name: Setup Bats and bats libs
         id: setup-bats
         uses: bats-core/bats-action@3.0.0
         with:
           support-path: "${{ github.workspace }}/tests/bats-support"
           assert-path: "${{ github.workspace }}/tests/bats-assert"
           detik-path: "${{ github.workspace }}/tests/bats-detik"
           file-path: "${{ github.workspace }}/tests/bats-file"
      [...]
```

## Windows and macos support

* Macos is fully supported for both default path and custom home path, just be aware that under `/usr` only `/usr/local/` is writable,
the rest is read only (you may consider to use an home path leverage the cache).
  * default libraries installation: `/usr/local/lib`
  * default temp directory (for dev testing): `/tmp`
* Windows is fully supported as well, however they may be some hiccup around the libraries installation in another drive that is not `C:`.
Please report any issue.
  * default libraries installation: `/c/Users/runneradmin`
  * default temp directory (for dev testing): `$HOME/AppData/Local/Temp`
